# Federalist Paper Text Classification

Utilizing Mendenhall’s Characteristic Curves of Composition, Kilgariff’s Chi-Squared Method & John Burrows’ Delta Method, compare two disputed texts from the famous Federalist Papers collection to determine the potential authorship. For historical context, of the 85 total papers, 51 are known to have been written by Alexander Hamilton, 14 were written by James Madison, 5 by John Jay, 3 co-written by Madison and Hamilton (Madison clamed primary authorship), and the remaining 12 are disputed between Hamilton and Madison. Our investigation will focus on Federalist Papers 49 and 50, two of the disputed collection whose authorship is debated between Hamilton and Madison.
